Extracting Data from XML

In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/xml3.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_2067227.xml (Sum ends with 38)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
Data Format and Approach
The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in XML as follows:

<comment>
  <name>Matthias</name>
  <count>97</count>
</comment>
You are to look through all the <comment> tags and find the <count> values sum the numbers. The closest sample code that shows how to parse XML is xml3.py.
To make the code a little simpler, you can use an XPath selector string to look through the entire tree of XML for any tag named 'count' with the following line of code:

counts = tree.findall('.//count')
Take a look at the Python ElementTree documentation and look for the supported XPath syntax for details. You could also work from the top of the XML down to the comments node and then loop through the child nodes of the comments node.
Sample Execution


$ python3 solution.py

Extracting Data from JSON

In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/json2.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum below:

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_2067228.json (Sum ends with 81)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
Data Format
The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in JSON as follows:

{
  comments: [
    {
      name: "Matthias"
      count: 97
    },
    {
      name: "Geomer"
      count: 97
    }
    ...
  ]
}
The closest sample code that shows how to parse JSON and extract a list is json2.py. You might also want to look at xml3.py to see how to prompt for a URL and retrieve data from a URL.

Sample Execution

$ python3 solution.py

Calling a JSON API

In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/opengeo.py. The program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and retrieve the first plus_code from the JSON. An Open Location Code is a textual identifier that is another form of address based on the location of the address.
API End Points

To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Open Street Map Data.

http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/opengeo?
This API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like. If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get "No address..." response.
To call the API, you need to provide the address that you are requesting as the q= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.parse.urlencode() function as shown in http://www.py4e.com/code3/opengeo.py


Test Data / Sample Execution

You can test to see if your program is working with a location of "South Federal University" which will have a plus_code of "6FV8QPRJ+VQ".

$ python solution.py
Enter location: South Federal University
Retrieving http://...

Plus code 6FV8QPRJ+VQ
Turn In

Please run your program to find the plus_code for this location:

King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi
Make sure to enter the name and case exactly as above and enter the plus_code and your Python code below. Hint: The first five characters of the plus_code are "7P52M ..."
Make sure to retreive the data from the URL specified above and not the normal Google API. Your program should work with the Google API - but the plus_code may not match for this assignment.
